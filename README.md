# Island Trails

[Island Trails](https://islandtrails.ca) is a not-for-profit, non-government, organization which actively supports the promotion,
development and enhancement of the trails on Prince Edward Island for healthy recreation and educational use.

This repository contains route maps and related information for the 11 trails that Island Trails manages or supports directly.

The route maps are derived from [GIS data gathered in the field](https://arcg.is/1K1nDf2) by Recreation PEI and processed
by the PEI Department of Transportation and Infrastructure. Each trail's route was extraced from ESRI shapefiles extracted from
the Island-wide coverage of that project, and the name of trail segments and trail surface preserved in the metadata.

## Updating OpenStreetMap

These layers were, in March 2023, used to update these trails' routes in OpenStreetMap, as follows, for each trail:

* Extracted a shapefile from the master Recreation PEI shapefile, and saved, preserving the T_Type, Trail, T_Name, and Manager metadata.
* In JOSM, downloaded the OSM data for each trail's area, and loaded the extracted shapefile for the trail as a separate JOSM layer (using the Open Data plugin).
* If the trail already existed in OpenStreetMap, existing ways in OSM for the trail were deleted, with metadata and relation membership saved for later reference.
* In the shapefile layer for the trail, selected the ways (Find > type:way) and applied the following metadat:
  * foot:yes
  * highway:path
  * name:[trail segment name or trail name]
  * surface:
    * "T_Type=Natural Walking" becomes "surface:dirt"
    * "T_Type=Boardwalk" becomes "surface:wood"
* After adding the ways from the shapefile for each trail were copied and pasted into the OSM layer.
* If an existing trail relation was present in OpenStreetMap, metadata and relation membership for each trail were updated, with the following translations:
  * "Trail:[trail name]" becomes "name:[trail name]"
  * "network" was set to "lwn" (Local Walking Network)
  * "operator" was set to "Island Trails"
  * For trails that form a loop, "roundtrip:yes" was set.
  * "source" set to "survey"
* If an existing trail relation was *not* present, then a new relation was created, with the following metadata:
  * "Trail:[trail name]" becomes "name:[trail name]"
  * "network" was set to "lwn" (Local Walking Network)
  * "operator" was set to "Island Trails" (or, in the case of trails managed by others, the Manager from the Recreation PEI file)
  * "route" set to "hiking"
  * "type" set to "route"
* The built-in JOSM warnings and errors were used to clean up inconsistencies in the imported shapefile; this mostly flagged situations in the Recreation PEI imported shapefiles where multiple points appeared at the same place/
* The resulting layer was uploaded to OSM, maintaining the original relation.
