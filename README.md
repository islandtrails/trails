# Island Trails

[Island Trails](https://islandtrails.ca) is a not-for-profit, non-government, organization which actively supports the promotion,
development and enhancement of the trails on Prince Edward Island for healthy recreation and educational use.

This repository contains route maps and related information for the 11 trails that Island Trails manages or supports directly.

The route maps are derived from [GIS data gathered in the field](https://arcg.is/1K1nDf2) by Recreation PEI and processed
by the PEI Department of Transportation and Infrastructure. Each trail's route was extraced from ESRI shapefiles extracted from
the Island-wide coverage of that project.
